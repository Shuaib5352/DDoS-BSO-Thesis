## ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must Address)
1. **NO Automated Tests** (0% coverage)
   - Need: Jest + React Testing Library
   - Target: 40% coverage minimum
   - Estimated effort: 20-30 hours

2. **Missing CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Need: GitHub Actions workflow
   - Auto-test on push
   - Auto-build verification
   - Estimated effort: 10-15 hours

### 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY
3. **Error Boundaries** - Catch React crashes
4. **Accessibility Audit** - a11y testing
5. **Storybook** - Component documentation
6. **Advanced Error Handling** - Better UX on failures

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
7. **Offline Support** - Service Worker
8. **Multi-language i18n** - Beyond Turkish
9. **Performance Monitoring** - User analytics
10. **Advanced Export** - More formats
